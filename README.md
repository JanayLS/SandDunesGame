# SandDunesGame
 You are a cowboy trying to defeat all of the mobs. Use the Left and right arrow to move from left to right. Space bar to jump (up arrow does not work). In order to kill them, jump on them. You gain points by hitting the mobs. You have 10 HP, so if you hit a mob on the sides you lose HP. If your HP gets to zero, the game starts over. The little water bottles make you gain 20 extra points.
